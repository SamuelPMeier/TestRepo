<h3 style="text-align: center;">Insertion Sort</h3>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pattern for this sort is to take an element of the list, compare it with all of the previous elements, which have already been sorted, and to incrementally move it down the list of sorted data until it finds its spot in the sorted order. Beginning with the first element in the list, it will simply stay where it is for now because there are no elements prior to it. Next the second element compares itself to the one previous to it, and will shift down if it is less than this prior element. Then the third element will compare itself to the second element, if it is less, they switch positions, and it will then compare itself to the first element and switch with that if it is less. This pattern of comparing and switching continues until all of the elements of the unsorted list have had the chance to compare to the other sorted elements.</blockquote>
