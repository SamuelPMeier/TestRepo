<p><h2>Insertion Sort Technical Description</h2>
<br />Given an unsorted array, an insertion sort algorithm will sort the elements of said array in ascending order.
<br />This algorithm traverses each index of the unsorted array with a for loop, starting with the second index.
<br />In each iteration of the for loop, the element in the array at the index being traversed is stored as the ‘current’ element.
<br />Then, a while loop continuously swaps the ‘current’ element with the element before it in the array until either:</p>
<ol><li>The element directly before the ‘current’ element is smaller than the ‘current’ element
<li>The ‘current’ element is at index 0</ol>
<p>Either of these conditions causes the while loop to stop and the next iteration of the for loop to start, until all indices have been iterated through.
